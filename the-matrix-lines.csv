Fuckin' idiots don't know shit.
What the hell...
"What do you want, Anthony?"
You got the money this time?
I don't know. I have to work
tomorrow.
"Yeah, yeah. Sure, I'll go."
How did you know that --
Who are you?
Trinity? The Trinity? The
Trinity that cracked the I.R.S.
Kansas City D-Base?
Gee-zus.
I just thought... you were a guy.
Do you want to go sorewhere and
talk?
That was you on the board tonight.
"That was your note, wasn't it?"
Who wouldn't?
What? Why?
I don't understand --
The Matrix. What is the Matrix?
Wait. Who was it? Who was the
man?
Shitshitshit.
"Yes, Mr. Rhineheart. Perfectly"
clear.
"If I was late again, I'm going to"
be fired.
Yeah. That's me.
Hello?
... no.
Who's coming for me?
Right now?
Holy fuckin' shit!
What the fuck do they want with
me?!
How?!
But what if...?
How do you know all this?
No! It's too far away.
"No way, no way, this is crazy."
This is insane! Why is this
happening to me? What did I do?
I'm nobody. I didn't do anything.
Fuck! Fuck! Fuck!
I'm going to die.
This is insane. I can't do this!
Forget it!
I didn't do anything!
Yeah. Wow. That sounds like a
real good deal. But I think I
have a better one. How about I
give you the finger --
And you can cram that file up your
Secret Service sphincter.
You ain't seen nothing yet.
You can't scare me with this
gestapo crap. I know my rights.
I want my phone call.
The agents --
... Yes.
What are you doing?
What are you doing?
Jesus! God!
Do what?
"Oh, shit --"
It's an honor.
You could say that.
"You're Morpheus, you're a legend."
Most hackers would die to meet
you.
No.
Because I don't like the idea that
I'm not in control of my life.
What gift?
It's not magic.
Free from what?
What truth?
How?
Apoc? You wrote the Four Horsemen
Virus.
A little.
"Essentially, it's a hardware"
system that uses an apparatus;
"headgear, gloves and whatever to"
make you feel that you are in a
computer program.
"You might not, no."
You did all this?
Shit...
What is this? Mescaline?
Uh-oh...
It's cold.
It's all over me --
... am I dead?
What are you doing?
Why do my eyes hurt?
"Morpheus, what's happened to me?"
What is this place?
When?
That's not possible.
How?
"Right now, we're inside a computer"
program?
This isn't real?
What happened?
No! I don't believe it! It's not
possible!
Stop! Let me out! I want out!
Get this thing out of me!
Don't touch me! Get away from me!
"I can't go back, can I?"
I told you I don't believe in
fate.
For what?
No.
You don't have...
Zion?
Jiujitsu? I'm going to learn
jujitsu?
No way.
Holy shit!
Hell yes!
This is incredible. I know Kung
Fu.
You -- You're too fast.
"I, uh... maybe."
I feel better.
Shit.
Okie dokie.
Yeah. Free my mind. Right. No
problem.
I thought it wasn't real.
"If you are killed in the Matrix,"
you die here?
Sorry.
What are you doing?
Is that... ?
"Jeez, I was wondering about that."
Why I was bald here but not in the
Matrix.
Residual self image.
"Life systems monitor, glucose"
levels.
Main power supply to the core.
Mainframe self-destruct. Uses all
remaining power to generate an...
E.M.P?
What's he talking about?
See who?
Did you have to do this?
What did she tell you?
Any of them true?
The agents. They're sentient
programs. They can commandeer any
software hardwired to the
mainframe.
The best hacking is always
traceless.
What -- what happened?
There is no spoon. Right.
Hello?
Hello?
You're the Oracle?
Yeah.
What vase?
"Shit, I'm sorry."
How did you know...?
Who?
I think so.
I don't know.
What's the good news?
"Is that it, then?"
You do?
Whoa. Deja vu.
Nothing. Just had a little deja
vu.
A black cat went past us and then
I saw another that looked just
like it.
It might have been. I'm not sure.
What is it?
I don't know. It just went dead.
It's Tank! He's alive.
Yeah. Right.
What are they doing to him?
How?
How much time?
The access codes to Zion.
You need help. I'm coming with
you.
Morpheus did what he did because
he believed that I'm something
that I'm not.
"I'm not the One, Trinity. The"
Oracle told me.
She said I had a gift but I still
had a lot to learn. She told me
maybe next life.
Why? It wouldn't mean anything.
He'd still believe what he wanted
to believe. But Morpheus is the
one that matters. He's more
important than me and we both know
it.
I may not be what Morpheus thinks
"I am, but if I don't try to help"
"him, then I'm not even what I"
think I am.
His friend.
Yeah?
That's why it's going to work.
There is no spoon.
Trinity!
... help.
Thanks.
I'm fine.
Can you fly that thing?
"Get up, Morpheus! Get up!"
He won't make it.
Gotcha!
Oh fuck.
"Morpheus, I know you won't believe"
me but the Oracle told ne I'm not
the One.
Don't!
Get outta here. Okay? Run! Go!
It was nobody.
"Let's go! You first, Morpheus."
I believe...
I want to kiss you.
So are you.
I already have.
My name is Neo.
"Mr. Wizard, Get me the fuck out"
of here!
"Hurry, Tank! I got some serious"
pursuit!
"I'm trying, Trinity. I'm trying."
Hi. It's me. I know you're out
there. I know you're working as
fast as you can to catch me.
I thought I should call and let
you know how things stand.
I know you're real proud of this
"world you've built, the way it"
"works, all the nice little rules"
"and such, but I've got some bad"
news.
I've decided to make a few
changes.
