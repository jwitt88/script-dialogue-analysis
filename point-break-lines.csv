 Halt. FBI!
 Yes sir. Sir?
 I did stop the perpetrators.
 Anywhere. I've just never seen the
 ocean before.
" Yes, sir."
 Sir?
 I take the skin off chicken.
 1322 last year in LA county. Up 26
 percent from the year before.
" Zero distortion, sir."
 I love these things.
 Not so far.
" The shit they pull, huh?"
 Punk. Quarterback Punk.
 Good move.
 They don't go for the vault?
 Smart. You burn time in the vault.
 Surgical. Look at them separate the
 dye packs. Dick and Ronny know
 their jobs.
" What's he talking about, Angelo?"
 Could've taken their gloves off
 before setting that card. Laser it
 for prints. Maybe held it to his
 teeth -- check the edges for saliva.
 Today was a scorcher. This Chevy
 doesn't have air conditioning...
" Well, what're your ideas on these"
 guys?
" So you're gonna coast to retirement,"
 when you could nail these guys and
 go out with come dignity.
 Sorry.
 Yeah. What's your theory?
 Oh well he must be a surfer.
 Candle wax. Car wax. Mustache wax?
 Could be anything. Guy's waxing his
 mustache at the beach. Gets sand in
 it. Wipes it off with a shoe. Shoe
 scuffs the counter.
 Sex wax? You're not into kinky
" shit, are you Angelo?"
 Thanks for the tip. I needed this
 knowledge.
 ... Four months. June to October.
 Mmmm...same the year before.
 They're traveling the rest of the
" year on the money, going where the"
 waves are...
 I think he needs a vacation.
 I don't.
 I'm twenty-five.
 Why can't I just walk around with
 this thing under my arm and act
 stoned? Ask a few questions.
" Angelo, this stuff is for little"
 rubber people who don't shave yet.
 Got it...
 Goddamn son-of-a--
 Fuck it.
" Well, I saw you and--"
" Hey! Uh, how do I get back in?"
 My name's Johnny Utah!
 I'm telling you so when you look
" back on this moment, you can"
 think... there was this guy named
 Utah and he was pretty much a dork
 but maybe not such a bad person and
 I let him drown in conditions he had
 no business being in whatsoever...
 when I could have easily helped him.
 Bye.
 Tyler Ann Endicott. Born 11-27-64.
 ... Exhibition of speed. Indecent
 exposure inside moving vehicle...
" Felony arrest! ""See adjoining"
" file""..."
 Kidnapping?!
 What else they got on her? I still
 haven't found anything I can really
" use. I gotta find an approach, a"
 way in -- here we go...
 Both parents deceased. Plane crash.
" San Diego, '84. Mmmm. Yeah,"
 definitely.
 Shrimp and fries.
 I need you to teach me.
 I'm serious.
" Well, I'm just gonna go back out"
 there till I catch on to it or break
 my neck.
" No, no. See, all my life I've done"
 things for other people. In high
 school I played football because my
 old man expected me to. Then my
 parents always figured I'd go to law
" school, so I did. Football"
 scholarship. Graduated Phi Beta
 Kappa--
" Wait, so I'm a big hero to my folks,"
 right?
 But two years ago they got killed in
 a car wreck and I just suddenly
 realized all my goals had been their
 goals. And I hadn't been living my
 own life. So I wanted something for
 myself. Something that maybe didn't
 make any sense. You know what I
 mean?
 I came out here from Ohio a month
 ago. Never saw the ocean before. I
 didn't think it would effect me so
" much. Like I'm drawn to it, or"
 something. I want to do what you
 do. It's the truth.
" Keep the change, Teach."
 Sure.
 Who's that?
" Yeah, my knee got folded about 90"
 degrees the wrong way.
 Two years of surgery. I missed my
 window. Limped through law school
 instead.
 Not yet.
 Fine.
 A little mushy.
 Babes.
" The correct term is babes, sir. Uh,"
 this type of undercover operation is
 entirely dependent on picking up the
 idiom of the speech. Otherwise
" penetration is not possible, sir."
" Of the social infrastructure, I"
 mean.
 Caught my first tube this morning.
" It sticks out, so I can't lock it."
" Look, Angelo, you think I joined the"
 FBI to learn to surf? This was your
 lame-o idea in the first place. You
 gotta back me up on this.
" Angelo, pay attention. There's"
 gonna be a test afterward. Lab is
 showing traces of toxins. PCBs.
" Heavy elements... selenium, titanium"
 and arsenic.
 The beaches are always being closed
" because of waste spills, right? And"
 surfers are territorial. They stick
 mostly to certain breaks. If we can
" get some hair samples, and get a"
" match to a certain beach, we'd know"
 which break the Ex-Presidents surf.
 You buyin' this?
" Whoa, brah, easy now... Don't move!"
 reaching for Surf-
 Got some huge sucker crawling into
 your--
 Got it! Uuuughhh.
" Saved your butt, bro. Close one."
 Latigo Beach.
 Big zippo so far. How about you?
" Okay, so this is where you tell me"
 all about how locals rule and yuppie
 insects like me shouldn't be surfing
" your break and all that, right?"
 Oh.
 What's your name?
" Well, listen, Bunker... I'm actually"
 kinda glad you found me.
" No, but there are four guys back"
 there you might check out.
" Friends of yours, huh?"
 What's their program?
 You always talk like this? You're
 not gonna start chanting or anything
 are you?
 Thanks for stepping in.
 Gonna be some people at my house
 tonight. Maybe you can make it.
 Where?
 You're losin' them.
 That's right. Two-denver-four-sam-
 niner-five-niner. Late seventies
 Jeep.
" Okay, Dad."
 The jeep is registered to a Bradley
 Wiess. My buddy. Guy's got quite a
 sheet.
" Yeah, yeah... skip all that. Gimme"
 the greatest hits. Misdemeanor
 possession of cocaine. That's
 good...
" ... Felony B and E, three months in"
 juvey. Better. Felony assault.
 Postgraduate work at Chino.
 Excellent. I'm lovin' it. What
 about the brother?
 Great! Another model citizen.
 These guys really fit the profile.
 These are the guys. I can feel it.
 I say we lay it on Harp.
" See you bright and early, guys."
 When did Harp say they'd have the
 warrant?
 Nice place.
 Don't you gamble?
 Who's the girl?
" Oh, oh. That sounds personal."
 Meaning you were expendable.
" Sure, he's ""the Bodhisattva""."
 All she does is beat the shit out of
 me.
 So what's the biggest? Waimea?
 Uh. I need another beer.
 What are you talking about?
 What's goin' on?
 I can barely do this in broad
 daylight.
 I gotta be fucking crazy.
 I know that part. Tell me something
" I can use, here."
 A flaw I'm working on.
" Yeah, right, vision is highly over-"
 rated.
" Shit, I'm gonna die. I'm gonna die"
 now.
 Yeah. I just want to sit out here
 for a minute.
 What?
 I... I don't know. I can't describe
 what I'm feeling.
 Goosebumps. Come here.
 Warm them up.
 Holy shit.
 You guys need any help?
" Right here, partner."
" I'm ready to rock, Angelo. Where"
 you want me?
 Got it.
 Babbit. Get Angelo out of there.
 They're pulling out a fucking
" arsenal! Babbit, you copy? Cole?"
 Don't let him pull his badge!
 FBI!! DROP IT!
 What the hell's your problem?
 Aw shit.
" I am a different person, Tyler."
 I... I gotta go.
 No. I'm sorry. I have to go.
" I'll, uh... I'll call you later."
 I'm sorry.
" Woof, woof."
" Angelo, we gotta talk."
 ... so I started tailing him.
" Bodhi, yeah. I'm on him all day,"
" right. He goes here, he goes there,"
 he goes to Tower Records and buys
" come CDs, he has lunch at Patrick's"
 Road House...
 ... he goes into the Assured Trust
 Savings and Loan.
 Cute. He was inside for about 20
" minutes. The other guy, Roach,"
 waited in the truck. They were
" scoping it out, right?!"
" Yeah, or cashing a check."
" Wait, wait. Then these guys go back"
 to their beach house and box up all
 their shit. Load it in Bodhi's
 truck and take it to a public
 storage unit. You see? Summer's
 almost over. They're splitting.
 They're gonna pick up a little
 traveling money tomorrow. The next
 day at the outside latest. I got a
 feeling.
 Angelo... I'm right this time. We
 can still win this one.
" Woof, woof."
 They're gone. Son of a bitch. We
 missed them.
 No way. Not yet. Come on.
 I say we call it in. Get some
 backup. But you gotta do it. Harp
 won't listen to me.
 I say we don't call it in. Under no
 circumstance are we to call this in.
" Angelo, it's eleven thirty."
" Here, yours is the one that looks"
 like a road kill. Enjoy.
 Here's your lemonade.
 Did you see that T-Bird pull up?
 FBI!! Freeze!! Right now!
 The hell are they?!
 You sure?!
" I got 'em. I see 'em. I'm on it,"
 I'm on it.
 Not now. Not now!
 Nothing.
 Feta. My favorite.
 I don't know.
 Ouch.
 You're kneeling on my hand.
" Never saw him, was your basic hit"
 and run.
 I'm glad you pulled me out of the
 water that day...
" Tyler, put the gun down."
 No. They live in Columbus Ohio.
 I work bank robbery. Guys I'm after
" are surfers. I needed you, at"
" first, but not--"
 Tyler! Wait!!
" Tyler I... look, I fucked up, okay."
 I know I fucked up. I wanted to
" tell you, but I couldn't -- I was"
" afraid you'd leave... good guess,"
 huh?
" Fuck, why can't I ever say what I"
 really mean? I lied to you. I'm an
" asshole... but I need you, Tyler. I"
 want you to know that I've never
 known anyone like you before in my
 life... and I... I hope you change
 your mind...
" Tyler! Wait, I--"
" What going on, Bodhi?"
 I don't think I wanna surf right
 now.
 How you figure?
 Takes guts to rob a bank. All that
" adrenalin pumping, waving loaded"
" guns, taking out the guards, getting"
" everybody on the floor, never"
 knowin' who's gonna burst in...
 ... wondering what it's like to take
 a bullet. Must be some ride.
 One shot stopping.
 Nice.
 Once.
" Sure, it's a blast, but listen, I"
 sorta screwed up my knee yesterday--
" Oh, well, that's fine then. I feel"
 so much better.
" So, who... uh, who packed my chute?"
 You gotta earn trust.
 We gonna jump or jerk off?
 Whoooaaah! Shhiiittt! Whoooaaah!
 Great! GREAT!
" After you, Alfonse. I insist!"
 You do it... you first!
 You first!
 Jesus Christ. I gotta be losin' it.
 What's this?
 You're a fucking dead man--
 Talk.
 You call him... right now... and
 tell him to let her go.
 We're wasting time.
 I can't do this.
" Bodhi, this is your wake up call,"
 man -- I... am... an... Eff...
 Bee... Eye... Agent!!
" On the floor, asshole! What's your"
 problem?! I blow your fucking
" kneecaps out, you'll be on the"
 floor!!
 Can we just get the goddamn money
 and get out of here?!
" You're blowing it, man! You're"
 breaking your own rules... pulling
 too much time!
 Federal agent! Undercover!
 Take your hand off my shoulder right
 now.
 I know where they're going.
 Only problem is... we can't arrest
 them or shoot them.
 I'm not armed.
 Good guess. There's a gun on you
 right now.
 Where's Roach?
 You gotta tell me where she is.
" Look, Bodhi man. People are dead."
 The ride is over.
 The guy you killed was an off duty
 cop! If you get out of here they'll
 nail you wherever you land. They
 have a new thing called radar.
 Maybe you've heard of it.
" I know you man, when they fall on"
" you, you won't back down. They'll"
 have to burn your ass to the ground.
 And I can't stop them... I'm the
 last person they're ready to listen
 to right now. Thanks to you.
 Shit may or may not happen.
" Look, you got a death wish, you want"
 to ride to glory... fine! But don't
" take her with you, man. I'm begging"
 you... tell me where she is. Then I
 walk away. We've earned that much
" trust, haven't we?"
 Angelo! Don't fire!
 NOOO!!
 NNNOOOOOO!!!
 You're cold because all the blood is
" running out of your body, Roach."
 You're going to be dead soon.
 I hope it was worth it.
 Tell him to release Tyler.
" What if your chute fails, Bodhi?"
 Rescind the order. Let her off the
" hook, she's served her purpose. Do"
" it, man, you owe me that much. Let"
 me hear it before you check out.
 FUCK IT!!!
 Pull the parachute!!
" No games, Bodhi. Pull the cord!"
 Now!!
 Pull it right now or I'll blow your
 fucking head off and pull it myself!
 You fucking crazy!? Pull it!!
 SHIT!!
" Jesus Christ, Bodhi!"
 Storm's already here... It's
 bringing me the swell.
 No. But he's here.
 No problem. Just give me a couple
 minutes with him first.
 I knew you wouldn't miss the fifty
" year storm, Bodhi."
 I'm not FBI anymore.
 I asked them to give me a couple
 minutes...
 He rode it all the way.
