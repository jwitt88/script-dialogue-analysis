 This is John.
 Ok.
 ...it had to be you...
 ...be seein' ya'...
 Be seein' you.
 Yes?
 Oh. Sorry.
" Well played, Norma."
 Well played.
 So... you gotta' name?
 Moose.
 Seriously?
" All right, then..."
" ...Moose, it is."
" I'm up, I'm up."
 That oughta' do it.
 Wanna' try it out?
" Good girl, Moose. Good girl."
 Thanks.
" It ain't for sale, kid."
 Maybe so... but I don't.
" Come on, then."
" Good night, Moose."
 Do you need to go out?
" So could I, it would seem..."
 What's gotten into y-
 Moose!
 ...Moose...
 Moose...
" Hello, Aurelio."
 Have you seen my car?
 Where is it?
 Thank you.
 Aurelio...
 ...they killed my dog.
" Aren't ""they"" always..."
 Where can I find Iosef Tarasov?
 Thanks.
" Evenin', Ed."
 No...just sorting out a few things
 with the Russian mob.
" Thanks, Ed... but you still owe me."
" Good night, Ed."
" Yeah, that was me."
" This is Wick. John Wick, that's"
" right. Yeah, it has been awhile."
 I'd like to make a reservation for
 four.
 Ten o'clock? Perfect. Thanks.
" You, too, Charlie."
 Thanks.
 I got me a hobby or two.
" Sorry, Charlie, but no. I'm on my"
 own nowadays.
" No, they don't."
 Thanks.
 I make no promises on that.
" See ya', Charlie."
 I called ahead. Reservation for
 John Wick.
" Depending on business, it may be"
 more.
" Y'know, I haven't been here in"
 years. When did the old girl get a
 facelift?
 Same owner?
 Is she still singin'?
 That's good to hear.
" No, thanks."
 Can you send me up a hamburger -
" rare, mustard, onions, pickle- and"
 fries?
 A nice Pinot. Mid-range. I'll
 leave that to your discretion.
 Thank you.
 Guest.
 Thanks.
 Thanks.
 A table.
" Yes, thank you."
" Single Malt. Irish, if you've got"
 it.
 And start me up a tab.
 Perfect. Do you have a meat and
 cheese plate?
 No. Thank you.
 My name is John Wick. You took my
 car. You killed my dog. Where...
 is Iosef?
 And where is Viggo?
 Where... is... Viggo?
 Please close out my tab.
 Good evening.
 Viktor is dead.
" As for the car, I got that back,"
" but as for Moose, well... I'm"
 takin' a page from Exodus on that
 one: an eye for an eye.
" No... no, better yet, Genesis."
" Adah and Zillah, hear my voice;"
" Wives of Lamech, listen to my"
 speech. For I have killed a man
" for wounding me, even a young man"
 for hurting me. If Cain shall be
" avenged sevenfold, then Lamech"
 seventy-sevenfold.
" Make your peace with God, Iosef..."
 ...for the Devil shall see you
 soon.
 Evenin'. Is the doctor in?
" Send him up, please."
 Depends. How good's your laundry?
" No, I thought not."
" Send me up a beer, too, will you?"
 Anything cold.
 Did she chip off?
 Good to hear.
 What sort of movement am I lookin'
 at?
 And after?
" Thanks, doc."
 Evenin'.
 Maybe not... but I know this place.
 No. Wait...
 Sorry.
 John Wick.
 How about you?
 You gotta' name?
" Pleased to meet you, Eddie."
" Please... call me, John."
" Hello, Winston."
" That, it has."
 I'm glad to see the old place still
 up and runnin'.
" Hey, Jimmy."
" I'm no good with time, but... it's"
 been awhile.
" She got the card, the flowers..."
 she knows you -all of you- loved
 her.
" And thanks, Jimmy. It meant a lot"
 to me as well.
 I'd love a martini.
 Good man.
" Thanks, Jimmy."
" Hey, Jenny."
" I'm not quite sure, but with that"
 said... here I am.
 I know.
" No, no, Jenny... go right ahead."
 In fact... please do. I'd like to
" hear it, too."
" No, ma'am."
 I hear.
 Do you know where Iosef is?
 Do you know where Viggo is?
 Do you know anythin' worth knowin'?
 Just because I'm good at killin'...
 doesn't mean I like it all that
 much.
 Give me something.
 What about it?
 That'll do.
 I'm thinkin' so.
" Hey, Harry."
" Night, Harry."
" Hey, Harry."
 You keen on earnin' a coin?
 Do you mind babysittin' the
" breathin' one for, I dunno..."
 ...the next six hours or so?
 Catch and release.
" Good night, Harry."
 You don't have to worry about that
 anymore. I'll be going to bed
 soon.
" Yes, in fact."
 For four.
" Perfect. Oh, and..."
 Do you cater?
" Excellent. I'll need a car, and..."
 well... something a bit less
 trivial.
 You willin' to put a bullet in my
" back, Marcus?"
" Been awhile, Marcus."
 Why'd you take the job then?
" Much appreciated, then."
" What am I doing, Marcus? I mean..."
" it is just a... was a... dog,"
 but...
 This isn't like me.
" Good night, Marcus."
" Yeah, that's about right."
 No.
" We tried, but... wasn't in the"
 cards.
 I figured as much.
 Imagine what one would do if they
 did.
" Goodbye, Viggo."
" Americano, please. And a bear"
 claw.
" Oh, and the bathroom?"
 Thanks.
 Not you.
 Take me to Viggo's stash.
 His stash. Personal Holdings.
" Piggy ""fucking"" Bank."
 Open it.
 Open it.
 So will I.
 That'll do. Thank you.
 No cops. That's new.
" Yeah. Yeah, we're good. Thanks."
" Unless I complete the call, then..."
 yes.
 No. I didn't.
 For Moose.
 Through and through... through and
 through...
 Buried deep.
 Fuck.
" Miko, huh?"
 That's quite the name.
 Are you coming or not?
 That's what I thought.
 Come on. Let's go home.
" Good girl, Miko... good girl."
